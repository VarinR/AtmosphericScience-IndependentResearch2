# Atmospheric Science Research Project 2

This repository contains an independent research project conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Travis O'Brien over Spring 24 semester, focusing on the relationship between higher local sea surface temperatures and increased probability of tropical cyclones, using data analysis 

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this research project is to investigate the relationship between higher local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the probability and intensity of tropical cyclones, by analyzing SST data, identifying regions with higher than average SSTs, and examining the correlation with tropical cyclone occurrences to better understand the impact of climate change on these weather events.

## Notebooks Overview

### First Notebook (SSTs1.ipynb)

#### Objectives

- To analyze SST data within the tropics, focusing on trends since 1971.
- Identify regions with local SSTs greater than tropical mean.

#### Key Findings

- **Historical SST Trends:** A clear upward trend in mean yearly SSTs in the tropics over the last fifty years was identified, highlighting a consistent increase in sea surface temperatures which sets a premise for further research into its effects on tropical cyclone activity.
- **Regions with Elevated SSTs:** Visual analysis pinpointed specific regions where SSTs exceed the tropical mean. These areas are of particular interest for investigating their contribution to an increased likelihood of TC genesis.
